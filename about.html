Founded in 2005 on the corner of Vine Street in Cincinnati, OH. Since opening day we have strived to bring our customers extraordinary tasting foods at a reasonable cost. Since 2005 Crunch N' Munch has opened another restaurant in Queens, NY as well as taken our food to the streets with our Cincinnati food truck.
